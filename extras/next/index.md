$$
\DeclareMathOperator{\diag}{diag}

In this chapter, we are going to discuss the various ideas that we have learned in the class and connect it to a bigger picture and look at where to go from here.

## Section 1

Below is an example math equation ([source code](https://github.com/csokolove/apcsa-notes/blob/main/extras/next/index.md#L16))

$$ p(x,z) = p(x|z)p(z) $$

with example text in between, followed by a sidenote with an image.

{% include marginfigure.html id="faces" url="assets/img/" description="This is a sidenote with an image" %}
Then, some more text.

## Section 2

Example paragraph with sidenote{% include sidenote.html id="note-onlineEM" note="This is a sidenote" %}, then continuing on.

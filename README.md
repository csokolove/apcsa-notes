**BASEPLATE CODE - NOT COMPILED WITH SCSS OR COMPLETED NOTES**

These notes are a consolidated & neatened version of notes for [APCSA](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/course), and have been written by [Charlie Sokolove](https://csok.dev).

This course introduces students to Java, as well as exposure to programming techniques found in various other places.

The compiled version is available [here](https://csok.me).

### Notes about writing math equations

- Start and end math equations with `$$` **for both inline and display equations**! To make a display equation, put one newline before the starting `$$` a newline after the ending `$$`.

- Avoid vertical bars `|` in any inline math equations (i.e., within a paragraph of text). Otherwise, the GitHub Markdown compiler interprets it as a table cell element (see GitHub Markdown spec [here](https://github.github.com/gfm/)). Instead, use one of `\mid`, `\vert`, `\lvert`, or `\rvert` instead. For double bar lines, write `\|` instead of `||`.
